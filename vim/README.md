# Linux systems

To enable clipboard functions you need the `vim-gtk3` binary. This enables the cliboard register.

```vim
:echo has('clipboard')
0
```
... means you don't.  Alternatively `vim --version` ... if `-clipboard` you don't have it (otherwise `+clipboard`)

# Colour management

`:colorscheme <C-d>` that's with a space and ctrl-d  shows available colour schemes

`:colo[r] minimalist` changes theme on the fly to *minimalist* in my example.
